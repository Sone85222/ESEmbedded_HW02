HW02
===
This is the hw02 sample. Please follow the steps below.

# Build the Sample Program

1. Fork this repo to your own github account.

2. Clone the repo that you just forked.

3. Under the hw02 dir, use:

	* `make` to build.

	* `make clean` to clean the ouput files.

4. Extract `gnu-mcu-eclipse-qemu.zip` into hw02 dir. Under the path of hw02, start emulation with `make qemu`.

	See [Lecture 02 ─ Emulation with QEMU] for more details.

5. The sample is designed to help you to distinguish the main difference between the `b` and the `bl` instructions.  

	See [ESEmbedded_HW02_Example] for knowing how to do the observation and how to use markdown for taking notes.

# Build Your Own Program

1. Edit main.s.

2. Make and run like the steps above.

# HW02 Requirements

1. Please modify main.s to observe the `push` and the `pop` instructions:  

	Does the order of the registers in the `push` and the `pop` instructions affect the excution results?  

	For example, will `push {r0, r1, r2}` and `push {r2, r0, r1}` act in the same way?  

	Which register will be pushed into the stack first?

2. You have to state how you designed the observation (code), and how you performed it.  

	Just like how [ESEmbedded_HW02_Example] did.

3. If there are any official data that define the rules, you can also use them as references.

4. Push your repo to your github. (Use .gitignore to exclude the output files like object files or executable files and the qemu bin folder)

## 1. 實驗題目 
1.觀察push與pop的功能
2.變更暫存器順序後是否影響結果？
## 2. 實驗步驟
1. 利用終端機觀察出暫存器的變化
2. 將暫存器順序r1,r2,r3,r4改變成r4,r3,r2,r1
## 3. 結果與討論up
由https://upload.cc/i1/2019/03/14/1VljMu.png可看出改變了push的暫存器順序,
當變更完程式後,可以看到結果https://upload.cc/i1/2019/03/14/1hUVOn.png在push
的暫存器順序以經自動更改成r1,r2,r3,r4
